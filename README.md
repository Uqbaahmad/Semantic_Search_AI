# Mercor AI Semantic Search Project 
## TASK
Task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence.
You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text.
The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. 
This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

## PROJECT Part -1 
In this project, I show how to revolutionize the way you search by combining the power of Semantic Search with GPT-3 question & answer. Walk through the process of extracting relevant answers from a large set of documents, creating embeddings with sentence Transformers, and storing them in vector database using Pinecone. Then, demonstrate how to use these embeddings to perform a semantic search and extract an answer using GPT-3.

## PROJECT Part -1 
In this project , I used the quora dataset to buid high-performance vector search application using vector databases.

<br/>
Pinecone makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications.<br/>
It's managed, cloud-native vector database with a simple API and no infrastructure hassles.
