# Nercor AI Semantic Search Project 
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence.
You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text.
The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. 
This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.
